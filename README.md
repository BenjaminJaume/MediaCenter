# Media Center

This is my very first personal PHP project. At the time, I was 16 and I was streaming a huge amout of films. It was really tricky because we had a really bad internet connection. Because I was programming a lot, I had the thought that I could automated everything.

So I took my old computer, set it up as a download machine, so it could download films 24/7. I also set it up as a local server so we could stream faster!

The Front End interface was pretty bad, as I was more focusing on the Back End side.
